Part 2: Repayment History ‚Äî PAY_0 to PAY_6 Columns
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Analyze repayment behavior and its correlation with default.
- Identify whether payment delays in recent months predict risk.

Business Questions:
- Are delayed payments strong predictors of default?
- How does payment status trend over months for defaulters vs. non-defaulters?
- Can we use repayment patterns to flag early signs of financial distress?

Metric Notes:
- PAY_X values:
    -2 = No consumption, -1 = Paid in full, 0 = Paid on time
    1+ = Payment delayed by X months

Next:
- We‚Äôll compute trends, compare PAY_X distributions by defaulters vs non-defaulters, and evaluate delay frequencies.

2.1 Analysis: PAY_0 Distribution vs Default Rate
-------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Assess how repayment status in PAY_0 correlates with default behavior.

Business Questions:
- Does a delay in most recent payment (PAY_0) indicate higher risk?
- Which PAY_0 values signal the highest default rates?

Suggested Use:
- Bar chart in Power BI with PAY_0 values on X-axis and default rate on Y-axis
- Risk tier grouping for credit modeling

2.2 Analysis: PAY_2 Distribution vs Default Rate
-------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Examine the impact of prior payment behavior (second most recent month).

Business Questions:
- How predictive is PAY_2 status for customer default risk?
- Are late payers in month -2 more likely to default next?

Suggested Use:
- Compare with PAY_0 chart to show decaying predictiveness
- Use as early indicator in credit scoring models

2.3 Analysis: PAY_3 Distribution vs Default Rate
-------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Understand how historical payment behavior (third most recent month) influences default risk.

Business Questions:
- Does customer reliability degrade or improve over time?
- How significant is PAY_3 in predicting future defaults?

Suggested Use:
- Create stacked bar visuals for PAY_0 to PAY_3 to show pattern over time
- Use in scoring formula weight calibration

2.4 Analysis: Payment Behavior Bands vs Default
-------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Classify customers by total missed payments and measure default risk per group.

Business Questions:
- How does cumulative payment behavior correlate with default?
- Can we categorize customers into risk tiers based on past performance?

Suggested Use:
- Heatmap or donut chart showing band-wise contribution to defaults
- Risk tier segmentation for internal credit controls

Analysis: Average Billing vs Payment Amount

Purpose:
- Compare average billed amount with average repayment to gauge repayment ratio.

Business Questions:
- Are customers paying off their full bill, partial, or very little?
- What is the repayment-to-bill ratio trend across the population?

Suggested Use:
- KPI card in Power BI showing payment ratio %
- Contextual insight for profitability and default risk

  ‚Ä¢ Investigated default rates by demographics, credit limit, and age.
  ‚Ä¢ Assessed repayment history (PAY_0 to PAY_6) and payment behavior patterns.
  ‚Ä¢ Identified early risk indicators based on missed payment trends.

Next Steps:
- Refine Power BI dashboards based on these insights.
- Implement ongoing data quality checks and refresh pipelines.
