Filename: 03_RFM_Analysis.sql
Project: Credit Card Analytics
Purpose:
- Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to identify and segment customers
- Assign RFM scores to help marketing, loyalty, and fraud-risk teams prioritize segments
- Build a reusable RFM view for Power BI and advanced queries
- Extend with loyalty, CLV, and cross-segmentation metrics

Author: Saharsh Nagisetty
Notes:
- RFM Scoring:
	Recency Score: 5 (most recent) -> 1 (least recent).
	Frequency Score: 5 (most transactions) -> 1 (least).
	Monetary Score: 5 (highest spend) -> 1 (lowest spend).
- Queries in this file are designed to support downstream Power BI dashboards and portfolio insights
- Complements 02_Core_Analysis.sql and 01_ETL_Data_Preparation.sql

ðŸ“Š Phase 1: RFM Segmentation and Customer Metrics
===================================================================
Objective:
Perform advanced segmentation on customer transactions using RFM logic
and extend the analysis with loyalty indicators, customer lifetime value,
and cross-dimensional slices (age, education, credit limits).

Focus Areas:
ðŸ”¹ 1. Build and store the RFM scoring model
ðŸ”¹ 2. Loyalty and longevity metrics
ðŸ”¹ 3. Lifetime Value (CLV) estimation
ðŸ”¹ 4. Cross-segmentation patterns (optional in Power BI)

1.1 Analysis: RFM View Creation and Scoring
----------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Build a reusable customer RFM segmentation view.
- Assign Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores to each customer.

Business Questions:
- Who are the most valuable customers (Premium segment)?
- Who are low-engagement customers (At Risk segment)?
- How can we prioritize loyalty campaigns or risk controls?

Suggested Use:
- Power BI slicers for segment selection
- Advanced segment-level performance reporting
- Marketing targeting and fraud-risk profiling

Technical Notes:
- Recency calculated as days since most recent transaction
- Frequency as total transactions
- Monetary as total spend rounded to whole dollars
- Scores are mapped 5â€“1 based on business rules

Summary:
- Developed an end-to-end RFM segmentation model including recency, frequency, and monetary scoring.
- Created a permanent view (`vw_CreditCard_RFM`) for future use in dashboards or analysis.
- Generated loyalty queries (active years, transaction value trends) to supplement RFM findings.
- Built a customer lifetime value (CLV) leaderboard to identify top contributors.

Next Steps:
- Incorporate these insights into Power BI as slicers or additional visuals.
- Schedule regular RFM recalculation with data refreshes.
- Explore cross-segmentation joins once consistent unique keys are aligned across datasets.
